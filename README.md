# Machine Learning Projects with Python

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Overview
In this project, we aim to build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The dataset includes information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and the binary outcome of survival.

### Project Steps
1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure of the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. **Feature Selection:** Identify relevant features contributing to the prediction.
4. **Model Selection:** Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for classification.
5. **Model Training:** Train the selected models on the training dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters for improved predictive accuracy.

## Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

### Overview
This task involves developing a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset comprises three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

### Project Steps
1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure and characteristics of the Iris dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Standardize and clean the data for modeling purposes.
3. **Feature Selection:** Identify key measurements contributing to species classification.
4. **Model Selection:** Choose appropriate classification algorithms for the task.
5. **Model Training:** Train the selected model on the labeled Iris dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Python

### Overview
This project focuses on sales prediction by forecasting product purchases, considering factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

### Project Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Gather relevant data on sales, advertising expenditure, and influencing factors.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and transform the data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Identify key features influencing sales and create new relevant variables.
4. **Model Selection:** Choose regression models suitable for sales prediction.
5. **Model Training:** Train selected models on historical sales data.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
7. **Prediction and Optimization:** Utilize the trained model to make predictions, optimize advertising strategies, and maximize sales potential.
